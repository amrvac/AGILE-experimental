title: Test cases

# Test cases {: #test-cases }

`$AGILE_DIR/tests/{hd,mhd,ffhd,srhd}/` holds AGILE's test suite: a mix of
short regression cases (built and run automatically by `make hd`/`make
mhd`/`make ffhd`, see [Getting Started](getting_started.html)) and larger,
physically motivated setups used as science demonstrations. This page
documents the cases that are also described in detail in the AGILE 1.0
paper, [Porth et al., "Astrophysics on GPUs: introducing AGILE 1.0"
(submitted to RASTI, in review; arXiv:2607.19277)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.19277)
-- the citable reference for AGILE 1.0 (see also
[Acknowledgments](acknowledgments.html)). Section numbers below refer to
that paper. To run any of them yourself, build and launch it the same way
as in [Getting Started](getting_started.html#first-run), e.g.

    cd $AGILE_DIR/tests/hd/KH3D
    make arch=gnu
    mpirun -np 4 ./agile -i agile.par

Beyond the cases below, `tests/` contains further regression and
verification setups (e.g. `hd/RT3D`, `hd/KH3D-SMR`, `hd/KH3D_tracer`,
`hd/sphere_advection`, `mhd/blast_wave_Cartesian_3D`, `mhd/Orszag-Tang_3D`,
`mhd/doubleGEM3D`, `srhd/shockTube`) that aren't individually described in
the paper and so aren't covered here.

# Hydrodynamics (`tests/hd/`) {: #hd-tests }

## Double Kelvin-Helmholtz benchmark -- `KH3D` {: #kh3d }
*(paper Sections 3.1-3.2)* Used to establish AGILE's baseline single- and
multi-GPU performance, rather than as a physics validation case. A fully
periodic, uniform-grid 3D domain `[0,1]^3` is set up with a horizontal
velocity field that switches sign twice across the domain height, so the
flow is Kelvin-Helmholtz unstable at two shear layers at once (hence
"double" Kelvin-Helmholtz). It uses Lax-Friedrichs (`tvdlf`) fluxes, van
Leer slope limiting and a three-step Runge-Kutta update; the code is
advanced for 100 timesteps and the average cell updates per second (CUPS)
is recorded. The paper's Figure 5 and Table 2 report measured performance
across device types (up to ~2x10^9 CUPS on an NVIDIA B200), and Section 3.2
reports multi-GPU strong- and weak-scaling results up to 2048 GPUs on the
Snellius and LUMI-G clusters.

## Double Mach reflection meets shock-cloud -- `Woodward_Collela` {: #woodward-collela }
*(paper Section 4.1)* Combines the classic Mach-10 double-Mach-reflection
shock test of Woodward & Colella (1984) with a dense spherical cloud
embedded in the pre-shock flow, demonstrating the
[hydrodynamics module](equations.html#eq_hd) together with shock-capturing
and adaptive mesh refinement in a genuinely 3D setting. The initial
condition sets three uniform states in contact: a static pre-shock medium
(density ρ = γ̂ = 1.4, pressure p = 1), a static spherical cloud of density
ρ = 10 and radius 0.25 centered at (x,y,z) = (7,0,0.5) in pressure
equilibrium with the pre-shock gas, and a moving Mach-10 post-shock state
(ρ = 8, p = 116.5, shock-normal velocity 8.25) separated by a planar shock
front angled at 60° to the x-axis. The domain is (Lx,Ly,Lz) = (10,2,1), with
reflective walls at z=0,1, continuous outflow at x=10, and time-dependent
boundary states at x=0 and y=2 that track the moving Mach-10 shock. HLLC
fluxes, van Leer reconstruction and a three-step Runge-Kutta update are
used, evolved to t=0.9. As the shocked cloud interacts with the reflection
pattern it develops Richtmeyer-Meshkov deformations and further
Kelvin-Helmholtz roll-ups.

`agile.par` runs a lighter `refine_max_level=3` version of this setup for
local testing; `agile_wc3d_6l_big.par` (paired with the
`job_lumi_gpu_6l*.sh` batch scripts) reproduces the paper's full 6-level
production run at effective resolution 7680×1536×768, which at peak
activated over a million AMR blocks (1.7×10^9 cells) and ran for 2944
node-hours across up to 2048 GPUs on LUMI. This case is a science
demonstration, not part of the automated `make hd` regression suite.

## Multiphase turbulent mixing -- `TRML` {: #trml }
*(paper Section 4.2)* A 3D turbulent radiative mixing layer (TRML) forming
between a hot, tenuous phase and a cold, dense phase in shear contact --
relevant to interfaces between hot coronal/circumgalactic gas and cooler
clouds. The Kelvin-Helmholtz-unstable shear setup follows the 2D noisy
benchmark of Lecoanet et al. (2015), generalized to 3D with band-limited
white noise at the interface; the radiative mixing layer physics follows
Fielding et al. (2020), using a hand-crafted log-skew-normal cooling curve
Λ(T) (mixing temperature T* = 0.2 MK, cold-phase density ρc = 10^-20 g/cm^3,
peak Λ(T*) = 8×10^-22 g cm^5/s^3) chosen so the cold and hot phases radiate
comparably. The temperature/density contrast between phases is χ = 100, the
ratio of the shear to cooling timescale is ξ = 10, and the hot phase is
mildly subsonic (Mach 0.3) while the cold phase is supersonic. HLLC fluxes,
van Leer reconstruction and a three-step Runge-Kutta update are used, with
custom static mesh refinement concentrated on the mixing layer.

A thin, fractal mixing layer develops as the layer migrates upward,
absorbing hot-phase material; the paper quantifies its fractal dimension by
subsampling AMR blocks (or isosurfacing) on a cooling-to-shear timescale
ratio, measuring d = 2.541, consistent with the d = 5/2 scaling predicted
by Fielding et al. (2020). Performance on LUMI reached ≳1.5×10^8 CUPS per
GCD, close to AGILE's uniform-grid single-GPU benchmark number.

## Cloud crushing -- `cloud_crushing` {: #cloud-crushing }
*(paper Section 4.3)* The classic "cloud crushing" problem (Klein et al.
1994): a cold, dense cloud is struck and disrupted by a hot wind, following
the setup of Girichidis et al. (2021). A wind of temperature Tw = 10^6 K,
number density nw = 10^-3 cm^-3 and velocity vw = 100 km/s enters
continuously from the domain's left boundary; a spherical cloud of radius
rc = 50 pc sits in pressure equilibrium with the wind at one of three
density contrasts χ = ρc/ρw ∈ {140, 240, 340}. The wind drives a
Mach ≈ 10 shock into the cloud, triggering Kelvin-Helmholtz and
Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities at the cloud-wind interface that ablate and
mix cloud material downstream; a seeded turbulent velocity field (Burgers
spectrum, vrms = 1 km/s) and small density asymmetry break symmetry to
promote realistic mixing. Radiative cooling uses the Colgan_DM curve
(Colgan et al. 2008 at high temperature, Dalgarno & McCray 1972 at low
temperature). The domain spans 20rc × 4rc × 4rc with the cloud centered at
x = 5rc.

The paper's default (χ = 240) run uses MUSCL reconstruction with a van Leer
limiter, the HLLC solver and three-step Runge-Kutta time integration, on a
base grid of 320×64×64 with 3 AMR levels (block size 32^3, up to 4096
blocks; effective resolution 1280×256×256), refined with Löhner's
indicator on a weighted combination of the passive tracer (80%) and
density (20%). Diagnostics track the cloud velocity v25(t) (the velocity at
the 25th percentile of the mass distribution along x) against the analytic
ram-pressure drag prediction, and the cold cloud mass fraction fcl(t); fitted
drag coefficients CD ≈ 3.1 are consistent across all three density
contrasts. Uniform-grid performance runs (1280×256×256, HLL solver, 32
MI250X GCDs on LUMI) reached ~1.1×10^8 CUPS/GCD.

# Frozen-field hydrodynamics (`tests/ffhd/`) {: #ffhd-tests }

## Multiphase dynamics in the solar corona -- `quadrupolar3D` {: #quadrupolar3d }
*(paper Section 4.4)* Demonstrates the 3D frozen-field hydrodynamics (FFHD)
module -- a field-aligned hydrodynamic module (see paper Section 2.3.2)
that solves mass, momentum and energy transport along a static, prescribed
3D magnetic field, including anisotropic (field-aligned) thermal
conduction. The magnetic topology is a quadrupolar two-arcade structure (a
fundamental arcade superposed with a third-harmonic arcade) with a shear
component that decreases with height, following the evaporation-condensation
prominence models of Xia et al. (2012) and Keppens & Xia (2014) but
generalized from their 2.5D configuration into a genuinely 3D sheared-loop
system. The domain is `[-5,5]x[-5,5]x[0,5]` in units of 10 Mm, resolved by
a uniform 600^3 grid (83.3 km resolution), initialized as a gravitationally
stratified chromosphere-transition-region-corona atmosphere with Colgan_DM
radiative losses. The atmosphere is first relaxed under a background
volumetric heating term, then a localized, stochastic heating term
(following Zhou et al. 2020 and Li et al. 2022) is switched on near the
transition region to drive chromospheric evaporation into the coronal
loops.

Optically thin cooling of the evaporated coronal mass triggers runaway
thermal-instability condensation: filamentary, cool condensations
continuously form and are channeled along the sheared quadrupolar field
toward the lower atmosphere, resembling coronal rain more than a
magnetostatic prominence. The paper also compares node-level throughput
against MPI-AMRVAC on equivalent hardware: enabling radiative cooling (RC),
hyperbolic thermal conduction (HTC), or both, reduces AGILE's throughput by
10.2%/21.8%/29.4% respectively (versus larger 23.0%/29.7%/41.3% reductions
for MPI-AMRVAC), so AGILE's throughput advantage over MPI-AMRVAC actually
*grows* with physics complexity, from 5.9x (baseline) to 7.0x (both source
terms).

The related `tests/ffhd/TI3D` case (adapted from MPI-AMRVAC's
`demo/thermal_instability_HD`) exercises the same FFHD thermal-instability
mechanism referenced in paper Section 2.3.2, in a simpler standalone
setting, and is wired into the automated `make ffhd` regression suite.

# Magnetohydrodynamics (`tests/mhd/`) {: #mhd-tests }

## Cooled Orszag-Tang evolution -- `Orszag-Tang-cooling` {: #orszag-tang-cooling }
*(paper Section 4.5)* A 3D variant of the classic Orszag-Tang vortex,
demonstrating the [MHD module](equations.html#eq_mhd). The original 2D
incompressible study (Orszag & Tang 1979) and its compressible ideal-MHD
generalization (Picone & Dahlburg 1991, parametrized by plasma beta β and
Mach number M) are widely used MHD code benchmarks; AGILE's variant uses a
triple-periodic domain `[0,1]^3`, adiabatic index γ̂ = 5/3, initial uniform
density ρ0 = 4, temperature T0 = 0.25 (so p0 = ρ0 T0 = 1) and plasma
beta β0 = 3 (so B0 = sqrt(2 p0/β0)), giving an initial Mach number
M0 ≈ 1.55. TVDLF fluxes with minmod limiting are used, together with a
user-defined uniform background heating term and optically thin radiative
losses (Colgan-DM curve), with physical units fixed via a Helium abundance
of 0.1, a length unit of 1 Mm, a temperature unit of 1 MK and a number
density of 10^9 cm^-3 -- chosen so the background heating exactly balances
cooling at t=0.

The run uses 4 AMR levels on a 100^3 base grid (effective 800^3),
refined on density and energy, evolved to t=1.8. The evolution first shows
the expected formation of current sheets and fast-mode shocks from
compressive deformation of the magnetic "islands" (matching the known 2D
case at t=0.4); by t=1.8 the initial slab symmetry is lost, and radiative
cooling drives runaway condensation via thermal instability -- the same
mechanism as the FFHD case above -- producing thin, connected,
low-temperature sheets with density condensations in their folds. The
paper's Figure 19 was rendered directly from the native `.dat` AMR
snapshot using the Intel Embree ray-tracing library. This case is a science
demonstration (see the `job_lumi_gpu_4l*.sh` batch scripts for the full
production run) and is not part of the automated `make mhd` regression
suite; `tests/mhd/Orszag-Tang_3D` is instead the classic, non-cooled 3D
Orszag-Tang verification test used there.

# Special-relativistic hydrodynamics (`tests/srhd/`) {: #srhd-tests }

## Relativistic jet -- `jet_3D` {: #jet-3d }
*(paper Section 4.6)* A relativistic jet propagation simulation
demonstrating AGILE's special-relativistic hydrodynamics (SRHD) module,
following the setup of Seo et al.
(2021) (with reflective rather than outflow boundaries outside the jet
nozzle, and the approximate Synge equation of state). An underdense jet
(η = ρ_jet/ρ_ambient = 10^-5) is injected with Lorentz factor Γ = 7 into a
uniform ambient medium representative of the hot intracluster medium
(number density n = 10^-3 cm^-3, temperature 5×10^7 K). The jet inlet
radius rj = 1000 pc sets a jet power of 1.09×10^45 erg/s (FR-II-like); the
jet is resolved by 12 cells per rj, in a cubic domain of side 80 rj, and
simulated for 6.5 Myr (42.8 jet-crossing times). AMR (4 levels) refines
automatically on density gradients as the jet advances, growing from 300
blocks initially to 31296 by the end. Lax-Friedrichs fluxes, van Leer
reconstruction, three-step Runge-Kutta time integration and CFL = 0.4 are
used; no flooring or other robustness fallback is required.

As validation, the paper reruns the identical setup in MPI-AMRVAC (initial
conditions and diagnostics are nearly 1:1 portable between the two codes)
and finds very good qualitative agreement in jet morphology and
recollimation-shock spacing (Figure 20). AGILE completed the run on one
Snellius node (4×H100 GPUs) in 16 hours (3.02×10^8 CUPS/device, 1.2×10^9
CUPS total), 5.3 times faster -- and about 3.6 times cheaper in compute
cost including IO -- than the equivalent MPI-AMRVAC run on 512 EPYC Rome
CPU cores.
